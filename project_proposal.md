### Abstract

We will be using agent-based modeling to simulate the behaviour of ant colonies (specifically, how the ants think and act individually, but end up working together to achieve goals). We plan to explore how simple rules can produce complex, emergent behavior.

This paper investigates the use of agent based modelling to simulate behaviour of agents sharing a common resource. In particular, the authors investigated the causes of "tragedy of the commons" situations, where the best thing for each individual agent leads to the downfall of the group as a whole.
