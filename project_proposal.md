### Abstract

We will be using agent-based modeling to simulate the behaviour of ant colonies (specifically, how the ants think and act individually, but end up working together to achieve goals). We want to explore how simple rules can produce complex, emergent behavior.

We plan to look at how ants gather food for the colony, using some combination of particle swarm optimization (swarm behavior) and ant colony optimization (graph traversal) to see what sort of behaviors we can generate.

P.J. Deadman; "Modelling individual behaviour and group performance in an intelligent agent-based simulation of the tragedy of the commons." Journal of Environmental Management (1999) 56, 159â€“172.

This paper investigates the use of agent-based modelling to simulate behaviour of agents sharing a common resource. In particular, the authors investigated the causes of "tragedy of the commons" situations, where the best thing for each individual agent leads to the downfall of the group as a whole.
