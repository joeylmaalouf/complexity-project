# Proposed Changes to the Established Model

- Non-arbitrarily set colony (having the system define the best location(s) for a colony as opposed to arbitrarily setting one beforehand)
- Limited colony "storage", limited food supply, limited carrying capacity
- If a colony runs out of "food supply", "disband" the colony
