# Proposed Changes to the Established Model

- Pheromone decay to establish a central, easier path
- Non-arbitrarily set "ant hill" (having the system define the best location(s) for an ant hill as opposed to arbitrarily setting one beforehand)
- Limited "ant hill 'storage'", limited food supply, limited carrying capacity
- If an "ant hill" runs out of "food supply", "disband" the "ant hill"
